This is a  basic tasklist where it allows user to enter a new task , and to delete and edit it as they wish.

As of current there are 3 diffrent function, Add, Edit and Delete.

User can chosse to add new task to the list by clicking on the Add button, any input on the textbox will be added 
to the tasklist. 

To edit the task list, user can click the edit button on the right side of each task. The current value for the 
task will be reflected in the textbox, user can choose to update the value by changing the value in the textbox
and clicking on the update button after. The value in the textbox will be reflected to the selected tasklist.
 
If user wants to delete the task, all they have to do is to click on the delete button at the right side 
of the task. The selected task will be deleted and the subsequent task will move up if there are any.

I currently face an issue where im not able to intergrate SQLite for the database, im a beginner in AngularJS therefore
